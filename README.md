# GEDicomReader

This is the first public version of GE Dicom reader for 4D flow MRI data.

I am working on making this code mre modular. You can fork the code in case you want to recieve an updated version.

In case you might have any question or even worst you find a bug in the code please contact me at: ali.bakhshinejad@gmail.com


## Usage

To see the defined flags use:
python readGE.py -h

Note: While this code is fully functional, however, it's no where close to full production code. There is no guarantees for this code! Use by your own risks.
Enjoy!
